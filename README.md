# ZimmerBot
ZimmerBot is an experiment with chat bots (with a German twist in the name ...).
It can function as an "Eliza" clone (see the ZimmerBotEliza project) or perhaps
as a personal assistant (see the ZimmerBot.Console project).

The program is given to the public domain "AS IS", so have fun and do not blame
the author for any problems you may run into.

## Credits

The ZimmerBot language is heavily inspired by both https://www.rivescript.com/ 
and AIML http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html.

ZimmerBot itself builds on a lot of NuGet packages from various sources:

- CuttingEdge.Conditions
- Ramone
- YaccLexTools
- log4net
- Quartz.net
- Antlr4.StringTemplate
- NUnit
