# ZimmerBot
ZimmerBot is an experiment with chat bots (with a German twist in the name ...).
It can function as an "Eliza" clone (see the ZimmerBotEliza project) or perhaps
as a personal assistant (see the ZimmerBot.Console project).

The program is given to the public domain "AS IS", so have fun and do not blame
the author for any problems you may run into.

## Trying it out

Load the solution, set startup project as either ZimmerBot.Console or ZimmerBotEliza, build, build, run and start chatting. 

The Eliza clone should be the easiest to get something funny out of.

## Credits

The ZimmerBot language is heavily inspired by both https://www.rivescript.com/ 
and AIML http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html.

ZimmerBot itself builds on a lot of NuGet packages from various sources:

- CuttingEdge.Conditions
- Ramone
- YaccLexTools
- log4net
- Quartz.net
- Antlr4.StringTemplate
- NUnit
