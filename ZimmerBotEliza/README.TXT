THE ELIZA PSYCHIATRIST
----------------------

This little example project demonstrates how ZimmerBot can be set up to mimic
the fameous Eliza chatbot invented by Joseph Weisenbaum in 1966
(see http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/572/S02/weizenbaum.eliza.1966.pdf).

Just run the program to start talking to your personal psychiatrist.

The implementation here is based on rules from a Python implementation of Eliza
found at http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/software/eliza.

OBS: This is a Danish bot - an English version may (or may not) follow later on.
