DEMO CHATBOT
------------

This is demo showing various bits and pieces of what ZimmerBot can do. The
common theme of the bot is to function as some sort of assistant that can
answer questions about weather, geography and other stuff.

Simply compile, run the project and start chatting with Dr. Zimmer Frei.

OBS: This is a Danish bot - an English version may (or may not) follow later on.
